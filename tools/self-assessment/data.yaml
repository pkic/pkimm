        description: |
          Trusted and secure PKI must be properly managed and supported by the organization. The existence of a strategy and vision for the PKI is one of the key factors for the success of the PKI and contributes to the overall maturity. The strategy and vision should be aligned with the organizational goals and approach and should be followed and measured regularly.

          Formal documentation about the business drivers, scope, and design of the PKI helps to ensure that the PKI is properly aligned and understood to support the organizational. The documentation should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that the PKI is aligned with the organizational goals and needs.

          Undefined or unclear understanding and leadership can cause loss of the established trust and can lead to the failure of the PKI quickly.

        name: "Policies and documentation"
        description: |
          Documented policies plays an important role in the secure and consistent management of the PKI. The goal is to minimize financial and operational threats and risks in the digital world. Well-described policies and security measures increase overall trust in the ecosystem of trust services and are a condition for successful operation. The basis for these matters lies in relevant laws and regulations, international standards and best practices.

          It consists of:
          - formal policies and practice statements for supported PKI services and use-cases
          - formal management of agreements between parties involved in the PKI
          - certificate and key management rules
          - roles and responsibilities in the management of the PKI
          - documented disclosure statements
          - maintenance and review of policies and documentation
          - code of practice for information security management, techniques and risk management

          Properly documented policies keeps the PKI assets trusted over the time and serves as a basis for integrated processes and procedures. It is a living management system that is continuously updated and changed as technologies, security, and compliance requirements change.

          The Certificate Policy (CP) defines the overall policies and requirements of a PKI, the Certification Practice Statement (CPS) provides detailed operational procedures followed by the Certification Authority (CA), and the disclosure statement offers transparency about the CA's identity and services to relying parties.

        name: "Compliance"
        description: |
          Compliance refers to the ability of an organization to adhere to relevant laws, regulations, and standards related to the scope of the PKI. A properly implemented PKI Compliance program ensures that an organization's PKI is protected from threats and risks that could result in financial loss, reputational damage, legal liabilities, or eventually in the loss of trust.

          The compliance process helps to manage a PKI in a way that meets legal and regulatory requirements, and ensures information is used and protected appropriately, according to defined and documented policies and practices statements.

          Compliance is important for several reasons, including:
          - It supports the risk management process associated with the PKI assets
          - Minimize reputation issues that can lead to the loss of trust
          - Provides assurance for the relying parties and subscribers
          - Proves adherence to legal requirements

          Overall, compliance and related procedures help to ensure that the PKI is managed and maintained according to the relevant laws, regulations, and standards. This minimizes the risk of loss of trust and provides assurance to PKI participants.

        description: |
          Proper and effective processes and procedures related to PKI operations and management are essential for the successful implementation of the PKI. The processes and procedures should be aligned with the overall organizational policies and statements.

          Process is a set of activities that are performed in a specific order to achieve a specific goal. The process should be documented and measured. The process is also repeatable and can be improved over time, based on the evaluation, feedback, or risk assessment. The scope of the processes is defined by the policies.

          Procedure is a set of instructions that describe how to perform a specific task. The procedure should be also documented and can be used as a reference for the process. Procedure can include specific instructions for the process, such as how to perform a specific task, or how to use a specific tool.

          Processes and procedure typically cover (but are not limited to) the following areas:
          - infrastructure management
          - data privacy and security

        description: |
          Key management is the set of techniques and procedures supporting the establishment and maintenance of keying relationships between parties and components in the public key infrastructure. Key management encompasses techniques and procedures supporting:
          - Initialization of system users and components;
          - Generation, distribution, and installation of keying material;
          - Controlling the use of keying material;
          - Update, revocation, and destruction of keying material; and
          - Storage, backup/recovery, and archival of keying material.

          The key management is important for the PKI to maintain trust. It should be an integral part of the PKI procedures. Proper key management is one of the basic stones on which the PKI stands and relies on.

          Certificate management is the set of techniques and procedures supporting certificate lifecycle management. Certificate management encompasses techniques and procedures supporting:
          - Definition of certificate profiles
          - Generation of certificates
          - Installation and orchestration of certificates
          - Inventory of certificates
          - State management of certificates, i.e. expiration and revocation
          - Discovery of certificates

          The techniques can be applied to an organization that makes use of PKI, or from an organization (or part of an organization) that operates a PKI for others. This category primarily targets an organization from a usage perspective, albeit the certificate lifecycle management is equally important for an organization that operates a PKI for someone else.

        name: "Infrastructure management"
        description: |
          The PKI implementation is a combination of software, hardware, network service, and resources that are needed to operate and manage the environment.
          The environment can be hosted on-premise, in the cloud, or in a hybrid environment.

          Independent of the hosting model, the PKI environment needs to be properly managed and maintained, which requires resources and processes.
          The infrastructure management refers to management of the technical and operational components of the PKI environment, which includes software, hardware, network, equipment, facilities, and other related resources.

          The PKI components may be distributed across multiple locations and managed by different teams. Therefore, it is important to have a clear description of the operational infrastructure with all dependencies and prerequisites. The infrastructure management should be aligned with the overall strategy of the organization and the scope of the PKI.

          When the infrastructure and environment where the PKI is implemented are not effectively managed and maintained, the complexity of the environment increases and the risk of failure increases as well. The infrastructure is often one of the key targets for attackers, therefore it is important to ensure that it is properly secured and available.

        description: |
          Change management and agility is important to control the PKI implementation and configuration changes, adjustments, modifications, and improvements. Technologies are changing fast and the PKI needs to be able to adapt to the changes.
           The same applies for security vulnerabilities, deprecation of algorithms, and other changes that can significantly affect the PKI.

          The change management should provide a robust and reliable process to ensure that every change is properly assessed, approved, and implemented. The process should be aligned with the organizational change management process and should be followed by all stakeholders.

          Agility means that the PKI is able to adapt to the changes quickly and efficiently. Agility is applied to technologies, processes, algorithms, and other parts of the PKI implementation. Efficient adaptation to the changes makes the PKI more reliable and trustworthy, reducing operational risks.

          Automation of certificate management is the process of using technology to perform tasks with reduced human assistance. Automation is used to improve the efficiency of the PKI management and to reduce the risk of human error. Automation can be used to perform tasks that are repetitive, time-consuming, or difficult to perform manually.

          On the other hand the automation can introduce new risks and challenges. The automation should be used only for tasks that are well-defined and that can be performed in a reliable way.

          Justified, well-designed, and documented automation of certificate lifecycle management can significantly contribute to the efficiency of the PKI management while reducing the risk of human error. However, automation is not a silver bullet and should be controlled, monitored, and audited to prevent the risk of misuse.

        description: |
          Interoperability means the ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged.

          A PKI is composed of multiple components, which are often provided by different vendors, or can be developed and maintained in-house. Interoperability keeps the PKI components working together and allows the PKI to function properly in the long term.

          Adopting open standards and protocols helps to ensure interoperability between PKI components and Relying Party (RP) applications and avoids vendor lock-in that may lead to interoperability issues in the future, especially when the PKI needs to be trusted for a long time, may have no control over RPs or needs to be scaled.

          Interoperability includes the following aspects:
          - Interface specifications
          - Data formats
          - Communication protocols
          - Algorithms
          - Open standards

          Main principles of interoperability are:
          - Transparency and openness
          - Technology neutrality
          - Reusability and scalability
          - Security and privacy
          - Accessibility
          - Sustainability
          - Portability and extensibility

        description: |
          Monitoring and auditing establish the necessary controls to detect and respond to security events and to provide evidence of compliance with the disclosed business practices.
          The events and logs typically serves as a basis for incident response and forensic analysis in case of security incidents, however, they can also be used for other purposes, such as performance analysis, capacity planning, and troubleshooting.

          Monitoring and auditing provide reasonable assurance that:
          - Unauthorized PKI system usage is detected
          - Critical high impact events are monitored
          - Appropriate logs are collected and relevant issues are alerted
          - The confidentiality and integrity of current and archived audit logs are maintained for the required period of time
          - Audit logs are completely and confidentially archived in accordance with disclosed business practices
          - Events and logs are reviewed periodically by authorized personnel

          The outputs from the monitoring and auditing activities are typically used as inputs for the risk assessment and management activities, including incident response management and investigation of high impact events.

        description: |
          PKI is a complex system that requires a lot of resources to be managed and maintained. Proper sourcing of the resources is one of the key factors of a mature infrastructure that can maintain and improve trust over the time. The resources can be:
          - Financial resources needed to maintain the PKI
          - Computing resources like hardware, software, tools, technologies
          - Human resources (personnel)
          - Management resources like processes and procedures 

          Sourcing is a process of defining the required resources and their specification, availability, and management. Sourcing requires monitoring and periodic review of the resources needed and alignment with the overall strategy of the organization and scope of the PKI.
