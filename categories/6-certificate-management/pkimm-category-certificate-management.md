# PKI MM - *Certificate Management*

## Overview

Certificate management is the set of techniques and procedures supporting certificate lifecycle management. Certificate management encompasses techniques and procedures supporting:

* Definition of certificate profiles
* Generation of certificates
* Installation and orchestation of certificates
* Inventory of certificates
* State management of certificates, i.e. expiration and revocation
* Discovery of certificates

## Requirements

> **Note**
> Overview of the requirements that are applicable for the category together with weights. This should serve as a quick overview of what should be assessed.

> **Note**
> The overview of requirements can be also used for quick assessment and reporting, because it contains references to requirements and may be filled with the assessment level.

| #                      | Requirement                 | Weight     |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|
| *[1]* | Certificate profiles are documented | *[Weight]* |
| *[2]* | Certificate cipher suites and protocols are documented and maintained| *[Weight]* |
| *[3]* | Process for certificate generation is documented | *[Weight]* |
| *[4]* | Methods for certificate installation are documented and roles are formally assigned | *[Weight]* |
| *[5]* | Inventory of issues certificates is documented and maintained | *[Weight]* |
| *[6]* | Certificate expiration is documented and monitored | *[Weight]* |
| *[7]* | Certificate revocation process is documented | *[Weight]* |
| *[8]* | Network certificates are discovered | *[Weight]* |
| *[9]* | Certificate management is periodically reviewed and updated | *[Weight]* |


> **Note**
> The weights can be evenly distributed to have each requirement with the same impact.

> **Note**
> Maturity level for each catogry is selected based on the assessment result and for the values refer to [Maturity Levels](../../model/pkimm.md#maturity-levels).

## Details

> **Note**
> Details about each requirement in consistent structure, containing guidance for the users how to assess the requirements and what is required to have.
