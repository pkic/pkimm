# Categories description

For the evaluation of the maturity level of the category, the following formula is applied:

```
category maturity level = (r1w1 + r2w2 + r3w3 + ... + rnwn) / (w1 + w2 + w3 + ... + wn)
```
where:
- `(r1,r2,r3,...,rn)` represents category requirements
- and `(w1,w2,w3,...,wn)` represents corresponding non-negative weights

## Category description

Each category is described separately in the following sections. The description includes the following information that is used for the evaluation:
