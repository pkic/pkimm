## Overview

*[High-level description of the category, its purpose and applicability]*

## Requirements

> **Note**
> Overview of the requirements that are applicable for the category together with weights. This should serve as a quick overview of what should be assessed.

> **Note**
> The overview of requirements can be also used for quick assessment and reporting, because it contains references to requirements and may be filled with the assessment level.

| #                      | Requirement                 | Weight     |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|
| *[Requirement number]* | *[Requirement description]* | *[Weight]* |

> **Note**
> The weights can be evenly distributed to have each requirement with the same impact.

> **Note**
> Maturity level for each catogry is selected based on the assessment result and for the values refer to [Maturity Levels](../../model/pkimm.md#maturity-levels).

## Details

> **Note**
> Details about each requirement in consistent structure, containing guidance for the users how to assess the requirements and what is required to have.
