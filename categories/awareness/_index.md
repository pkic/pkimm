# Awareness

## Overview

Providing awareness about the PKI and its purpose in the organization and outside ensures that ech PKI participant understands it properly and is timely informed about any important events that may have impact on the participant.

The awareness is important for all PKI participants to know how to handle exceptional situations and how to react on them. It is also important to know how to communicate and when and to not misunderstand any issues or incidents.
